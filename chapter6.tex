\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\section{Summary}
	The overall goal of this project was to optimize respiratory navigator gating to improve the clinical utility of spiral cine DENSE cardiac MRI. To accomplish this goal, we completed three separate respiratory-related studies: 1) determined how using a respiratory navigator affects the reproducibility of measures of cardiac mechanics, 2)
	
	summarize each study, what you did, results, and conclusion (basically an short abstract for each one)
	
\section{Future Directions}
	Distribute videogame to research sites. have them use in patients since we only measure things in healthy subects
	
	- children who have duchense muscular distrophy
	- adults with heart disease and failure
	see if same conclusions hold.
	
	re-design videogame using more general, free (and not expensive license-based software) so that it can be distrbuted easier
	
	incorporate videogame into siemens scanner itself as an option instead of regular respiratory navigator
