abstract = {PURPOSE: To correct for spatial misregistration of multi-breath-hold short-axis (SA), two-chamber (2CH), and four-chamber (4CH) cine cardiac MR (CMR) images caused by respiratory and patient motion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty CMR studies from consecutive patients with separate breath-hold 2CH, 4CH, and SA 20-phase cine images were considered. We automatically registered the 2CH, 4CH, and SA images in three dimensions by minimizing the cost function derived from plane intersections for all cine phases. The automatic alignment was compared with manual alignment by two observers. RESULTS: The processing time for the proposed method was {\textless}20 seconds, compared to 14-24 minutes for the manual correction. The initial plane displacement identified by the observers was 2.8 +/- 1.8 mm (maximum = 14 mm). A displacement of {\textgreater}/=5 mm was identified in 15 of 20 studies. The registration accuracy (defined as the difference between the automatic parameters and those obtained by visual registration) was 1.0 +/- 0.9 mm, 1.1 +/- 1.0 mm, 1.1 +/- 1.2 mm, and 2.0 +/- 1.8 mm for 2CH-4CH alignment and SA alignment in the mid, basal, and apical regions, respectively. The algorithm variability was higher in the apex (2.0 +/- 1.9 mm) than in the mid (1.4 +/- 1.4 mm) or basal (1.2 +/- 1.2 mm) regions (ANOVA, P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: An automated preprocessing algorithm can reduce spatial misregistration between multiple CMR images acquired at different breath-holds and plane orientations.},

abstract = {Cardiac MRI was performed in human volunteers to determine the magnitude of the misregistration (MSR) of cardiac landmarks due to variability in the diaphragm position for repeated breath-holds. Seven normal volunteers underwent MR imaging of the left ventricle (LV) to evaluate the magnitude of the endocardial centroid MSR. The MSR for a mid-ventricle short-axis image was 3.01 +/- 1.68 mm through-plane and 4.16 +/- 1.62 mm in-plane. A second order polynomial fit through the LV centroid coordinates minimized the in-plane component of the MSR error. Short-axis cine images, corrected for MSR, provided high-resolution 2D data from which an accurate anatomical model of the LV was generated. Anatomical landmarks were used to register parametric maps of myocardial perfusion and viability to the three-dimensional (3D) model, with the corresponding parameters displayed as color-encoded values on the endo- and epicardial surfaces of the LV. Registration of regional wall motion, perfusion and viability to the 3D model was performed for three patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The proposed 3D reconstruction technique allows visualization in 3D of the LV anatomy, in combination with parametric mapping of its functional status.},

abstract = {Background: Advanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) acquisitions often require long scan durations that necessitate respiratory navigator gating. The tradeoff of navigator gating is reduced scan efficiency, particularly when the patient's breathing patterns are inconsistent, as is commonly seen in children. We hypothesized that engaging pediatric participants with a navigator-controlled videogame to help control breathing patterns would improve navigator efficiency and maintain image quality. Methods: We developed custom software that processed the Siemens respiratory navigator image in real-time during CMR and represented diaphragm position using a cartoon avatar, which was projected to the participant in the scanner as visual feedback. The game incentivized children to breathe such that the avatar was positioned within the navigator acceptance window (±3 mm) throughout image acquisition. Using a 3T Siemens Tim Trio, 50 children (Age: 14 ± 3 years, 48 {\%} female) with no significant past medical history underwent a respiratory navigator-gated 2D spiral cine displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) CMR acquisition first with no feedback (NF) and then with the feedback game (FG). Thirty of the 50 children were randomized to undergo extensive off-scanner training with the FG using a MRI simulator, or no off-scanner training. Navigator efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and global left-ventricular strains were determined for each participant and compared. Results: Using the FG improved average navigator efficiency from 33 ± 15 to 58 ± 13 {\%} (p {\textless} 0.001) and improved SNR by 5 {\%} (p = 0.01) compared to acquisitions with NF. There was no difference in navigator efficiency (p = 0.90) or SNR (p = 0.77) between untrained and trained participants for FG acquisitions. Circumferential and radial strains derived from FG acquisitions were slightly reduced compared to NF acquisitions (−16 ± 2 {\%} vs −17 ± 2 {\%}, p {\textless} 0.001; 40 ± 10 {\%} vs 44 ± 11 {\%}, p = 0.005, respectively). There were no differences in longitudinal strain (p = 0.38). Conclusions: Use of a respiratory navigator feedback game during navigator-gated CMR improved navigator efficiency in children from 33 to 58 {\%}. This improved efficiency was associated with a 5 {\%} increase in SNR for spiral cine DENSE. Extensive off-scanner training was not required to achieve the improvement in navigator efficiency.

abstract = {Coronary artery MRI methods utilize breath holds, or diaphragmatic navigators, to compensate for respiratory motion. To increase image quality and navigator (NAV) gating efficiency, slice tracking is used, with more sophisticated affine motion models recently introduced. This study assesses the extent of remaining coronary artery motion in free breathing NAV and single and multi breath hold coronary artery MRI. Additionally, the effect of the NAV gating window size was examined. To visualize and measure the respiratory induced motion, an image containing a coronary artery cross section was acquired at each heartbeat. The amount of residual coronary artery displacement was used as a direct measure for the performance of the respiratory motion correction method. Free breathing studies with motion compensation (slice tracking with 5 mm gating window) had a similar amount of residual motion (0.76+/-0.17 mm) as a single breath hold (0.52+/-0.20 mm) and were superior to multiple breath holds (1.22+/-0.60 mm). Affine NAV methods allowed for larger gating windows ( approximately 10 mm windows) with similar residual motion (0.74+/-0.17 mm). In this healthy adult cohort (N=10), free-breathing NAV methods offered respiratory motion suppression similar to a single breath hold.},

abstract = {Objectives: To compare a steady-state free precession cine sequence-based technique (feature tracking [FT]) to tagged harmonic phase (HARP) analysis for peak average circumferential myocardial strain ($\epsilon$cc) analysis in a large and heterogeneous population of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Background: Current $\epsilon$cc assessment techniques require cardiac magnetic resonance-tagged imaging sequences, and their analysis is complex. The FT method can readily be performed on standard cine (steady-state free precession) sequences. Methods: We compared mid-left ventricular whole-slice $\epsilon$cc by the 2 techniques in 191 DMD patients grouped according to age and severity of cardiac dysfunction: group B: DMD patients 10 years and younger with normal ejection fraction (EF); group C: DMD patients older than 10 years with normal EF; group D: DMD patients older than 10 years with reduced EF but negative myocardial delayed enhancement (MDE); group E: DMD patients older than 10 years with reduced EF and positive MDE; and group A: 42 control subjects. Retrospective, offline analysis was performed on matched tagged and steady-state free precession slices. Results: For the entire study population (N = 233), mean FT $\epsilon$cc values (-13.3 ± 3.8{\%}) were highly correlated with HARP $\epsilon$cc values (-13.6 ± 3.4{\%}), with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.899. The mean $\epsilon$cc of DMD patients determined by HARP (-12.52 ± 2.69{\%}) and FT (-12.16 ± 3.12{\%}) was not significantly different (p = NS). Similarly, the mean $\epsilon$cc of the control subjects by determined HARP (-18.85 ± 1.86) and FT (-18.81 ± 1.83) was not significantly different (p = NS). Excellent correlation between the 2 methods was found among subgroups A through E, except there was no significant difference in strain between groups B and C with FT analysis. Conclusions: FT-based assessment of $\epsilon$cc correlates highly with $\epsilon$cc derived from tagged images in a large DMD patient population with a wide range of cardiac dysfunction and can be performed without additional imaging. {\textcopyright} 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advanced measures of cardiac function are increasingly important to clinical assessment due to their superior diagnostic and predictive capabilities. Cine DENSE cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is ideal for quantifying advanced measures of cardiac function based on its high spatial resolution and streamlined post-processing. While many studies have utilized cine DENSE in both humans and small-animal models, the inter-test and inter-observer reproducibility for quantification of advanced cardiac function in mice has not been evaluated. This represents a critical knowledge gap for both understanding the capabilities of this technique and for the design of future experiments. We hypothesized that cine DENSE CMR would show excellent inter-test and inter-observer reproducibility for advanced measures of left ventricular (LV) function in mice.

METHODS: Five normal mice (C57BL/6) and four mice with depressed cardiac function (diet-induced obesity) were imaged twice, two days apart, on a 7T ClinScan MR system. Images were acquired with 15-20 frames per cardiac cycle in three short-axis (basal, mid, apical) and two long-axis orientations (4-chamber and 2-chamber). LV strain, twist, torsion, and measures of synchrony were quantified. Images from both days were analyzed by one observer to quantify inter-test reproducibility, while inter-observer reproducibility was assessed by a second observer's analysis of day-1 images. The coefficient of variation (CoV) was used to quantify reproducibility.

RESULTS: LV strains and torsion were highly reproducible on both inter-observer and inter-test bases with CoVs ≤ 15{\%}, and inter-observer reproducibility was generally better than inter-test reproducibility. However, end-systolic twist angles showed much higher variance, likely due to the sensitivity of slice location within the sharp longitudinal gradient in twist angle. Measures of synchrony including the circumferential (CURE) and radial (RURE) uniformity of strain indices, showed excellent reproducibility with CoVs of 1{\%} and 3{\%}, respectively. Finally, peak measures (e.g., strains) were generally more reproducible than the corresponding rates of change (e.g., strain rate).

CONCLUSIONS: Cine DENSE CMR is a highly reproducible technique for quantification of advanced measures of left ventricular cardiac function in mice including strains, torsion and measures of synchrony. However, myocardial twist angles are not reproducible and future studies should instead report torsion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) encodes displacement into the phase of the magnetic resonance signal. Due to the stimulated echo, the signal is inherently low and fades through the cardiac cycle. To compensate, a spiral acquisition has been used at 1.5T. This spiral sequence has not been validated at 3T, where the increased signal would be valuable, but field inhomogeneities may result in measurement errors. We hypothesized that spiral cine DENSE is valid at 3T and tested this hypothesis by measuring displacement errors at both 1.5T and 3T in vivo. METHODS Two-dimensional spiral cine DENSE and tagged imaging of the left ventricle were performed on ten healthy subjects at 3T and six healthy subjects at 1.5T. Intersection points were identified on tagged images near end-systole. Displacements from the DENSE images were used to project those points back to their origins. The deviation from a perfect grid was used as a measure of accuracy and quantified as root-mean-squared error. This measure was compared between 3T and 1.5T with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Inter-observer variability of strains and torsion quantified by DENSE and agreement between DENSE and harmonic phase (HARP) were assessed by Bland-Altman analyses. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) at each cardiac phase was compared between 3T and 1.5T with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. RESULTS The displacement accuracy of spiral cine DENSE was not different between 3T and 1.5T (1.2 ± 0.3 mm and 1.2 ± 0.4 mm, respectively). Both values were lower than the DENSE pixel spacing of 2.8 mm. There were no substantial differences in inter-observer variability of DENSE or agreement of DENSE and HARP between 3T and 1.5T. Relative to 1.5T, the SNR at 3T was greater by a factor of 1.4 ± 0.3. CONCLUSIONS The spiral cine DENSE acquisition that has been used at 1.5T to measure cardiac displacements can be applied at 3T with equivalent accuracy. The inter-observer variability and agreement of DENSE-derived peak strains and torsion with HARP is also comparable at both field strengths. Future studies with spiral cine DENSE may take advantage of the additional SNR at 3T.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) encodes displacement into the phase of the magnetic resonance signal. The encoding frequency (ke) maps the measured phase to tissue displacement while the strength of the encoding gradients affects image quality. 2D cine DENSE studies have used a ke of 0.10 cycles/mm, which is high enough to remove an artifact-generating echo from k-space, provide high sensitivity to tissue displacements, and dephase the blood pool. However, through-plane dephasing can remove the unwanted echo and dephase the blood pool without relying on high ke. Additionally, the high sensitivity comes with the costs of increased phase wrapping and intra-voxel dephasing. We hypothesized that ke below 0.10 cycles/mm can be used to improve image characteristics and provide accurate measures of cardiac mechanics. METHODS Spiral cine DENSE images were obtained for 10 healthy subjects and 10 patients with a history of heart disease on a 3 T Siemens Trio. A mid-ventricular short-axis image was acquired with different ke: 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.10 cycles/mm. Peak twist, circumferential strain, and radial strain were compared between acquisitions employing different ke using Bland-Altman analyses and coefficients of variation. The percentage of wrapped pixels in the phase images at end-systole was calculated for each ke. The dephasing of the blood signal and signal to noise ratio (SNR) were also calculated and compared. RESULTS Negligible differences were seen in strains and twist for all ke between 0.04 and 0.10 cycles/mm. These differences were of the same magnitude as inter-test differences. Specifically, the acquisitions with 0.04 cycles/mm accurately quantified cardiac mechanics and had zero phase wrapping. Compared to 0.10 cycles/mm, the acquisitions with 0.04 cycles/mm had 9 {\%} greater SNR and negligible differences in blood pool dephasing. CONCLUSIONS For 2D cine DENSE with through-plane dephasing, the encoding frequency can be lowered to 0.04 cycles/mm without compromising the quantification of twist or strain. The amount of wrapping can be reduced with this lower value to greatly simplify the input to unwrapping algorithms. The strain and twist results from studies using different encoding frequencies can be directly compared.},

Peak torsion was reduced by 34{\%} (p = 0.028). Synchrony of contraction was also reduced (p = 0.032) with a time delay in the septal-to-lateral direction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Diet-induced obesity reduces left ventricular strains and torsion in mice. Reductions in cardiac strain are mostly limited to the subepicardium, with relative preservation of function in the subendocardium. Diet-induced obesity also leads to reduced synchrony of contraction and hypertrophy in mouse models.},

The heart is tagged using 1-1 SPAMM at end-diastole with tag surfaces parallel to a short-axis imaging plane. Two or more images are acquired such that the images have different phase encodings in a direction orthogonal to the image plane. A dense map of the longitudinal strain can be computed from these images using a simple, fast computation. Simulations are conducted to study the effect of noise and the choice of out-of-plane phase encoding values. Longitudinal strains acquired from a normal human male are shown.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction is normal or increased, and force-length relations are reduced. However, three-dimensional (3D) motion and deformation in vivo have not been assessed in this condition. We have reconstructed the 3D motion of the left ventricle (LV) during systole in 7 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 12 normal volunteers by use of magnetic resonance tagging. METHODS AND RESULTS: Transmural tagging stripes were automatically tracked to subpixel resolution with an active contour model. A 3D finite-element model was used to interpolate displacement information between short- and long-axis slices and register data on a regional basis. Displacement and strain data were averaged into septal, posterior, lateral, and anterior regions at basal, midventricular, and apical levels. Radial motion (toward the central long axis) decreased slightly in patients with HCM, whereas longitudinal displacement (parallel to the long axis) of the base toward the apex was markedly reduced: 7.5 +/- 2.5mm (SD) versus 12.5 +/- 2.0 mm, P {\textless} .001. Circumferential and longitudinal shortening were both reduced in the septum (P {\textless} .01 at all levels). The principal strain associated with 3D maximal contraction was slightly depressed in many regions, significantly in the basal septum (-0.18 +/- 0.05 versus -0.22 +/- 0.02, P {\textless} .05) and anterior (-0.20 +/- 0.05 versus -0.23 +/- 0.02, P {\textless} .05) walls. In contrast, LV torsion (twist of the apex about the long axis relative to the base) was greater in HCM patients (19.9 +/- 2.4 degrees versus 14.6 +/- 2.7 degrees, P {\textless} .01). CONCLUSIONS: HCM patients had reduced 3D myocardial shortening on a regional basis; however, LV torsion was increased.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In lung radiotherapy, variations in cycle-to-cycle breathing results in four-dimensional computed tomography imaging artifacts, leading to inaccurate beam coverage and tumor targeting. In previous studies, the effect of audiovisual (AV) biofeedback on the external respiratory signal reproducibility has been investigated but the internal anatomy motion has not been fully studied. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that AV biofeedback improves diaphragm motion reproducibility of internal anatomy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: To test the hypothesis 15 healthy human subjects were enrolled in an ethics-approved AV biofeedback study consisting of two imaging sessions spaced approximately 1 week apart. Within each session MR images were acquired under free breathing and AV biofeedback conditions. The respiratory signal to the AV biofeedback system utilized optical monitoring of an external marker placed on the abdomen. Synchronously, serial thoracic 2D MR images were obtained to measure the diaphragm motion using a fast gradient-recalled-echo MR pulse sequence in both coronal and sagittal planes. The improvement in the diaphragm motion reproducibility using the AV biofeedback system was quantified by comparing cycle-to-cycle variability in displacement, respiratory period, and baseline drift. Additionally, the variation in improvement between the two sessions was also quantified. RESULTS: The average root mean square error (RMSE) of diaphragm cycle-to-cycle displacement was reduced from 2.6 mm with free breathing to 1.6 mm (38{\%} reduction) with the implementation of AV biofeedback (p-value {\textless} 0.0001). The average RMSE of the respiratory period was reduced from 1.7 s with free breathing to 0.3 s (82{\%} reduction) with AV biofeedback (p-value {\textless} 0.0001). Additionally, the average baseline drift obtained using a linear fit was reduced from 1.6 mmmin with free breathing to 0.9 mmmin (44{\%} reduction) with AV biofeedback (p-value = 0.012). The diaphragm motion reproducibility improvements with AV biofeedback were consistent with the abdominal motion reproducibility that was observed from the external marker motion variation. CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to investigate the potential of AV biofeedback to improve the motion reproducibility of internal anatomy using MRI. The study demonstrated the significant improvement in diaphragm motion reproducibility using AV biofeedback combined with MRI. This system can potentially provide clinically beneficial motion management of internal anatomy in MRI and radiotherapy.},

abstract = {Background Three-dimensional (3D) speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) is an emerging technology used to quantify left ventricular (LV) function. However, the accuracy and normal values of LV strain and twist using 3D STE have not been established in a large group of normal subjects. The aims of this study were to (1) to evaluate the accuracy of 3D STE analysis of LV strain against a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) reference and (2) to establish age-related normal values of LV strain and torsion using real-time 3D echocardiographic (RT3DE) images. Methods In protocol 1, RT3DE data sets and CMR images were acquired on the same day in 19 patients referred for clinically indicated CMR. Global LV longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain was compared between the two modalities. In protocol 2, global and regional strain and twist and torsion were measured in 313 healthy subjects using 3D STE. Results In protocol 1, good correlations for each LV strain component were noted between RT3DE imaging and CMR (r = 0.61-0.86, P {\textless}.001). In protocol 2, normal global longitudinal, circumferential, radial, and 3D strain were -20.3 ?? 3.2{\%}, -28.9 ?? 4.6{\%}, 88.0 ?? 21.8{\%}, and -37.6 ?? 4.8{\%}, respectively. A significant age dependency was observed for global longitudinal and 3D strain. Aging also affected LV torsion: the lowest values were found in children and adolescents, and values subsequently increased with age, while further aging was associated with a gradual reduction in basal rotation accompanied by an increase in apical rotation. Conclusions This study provides initial validation of 3D strain analysis from RT3DE images and reference values of normal 3D LV strain and torsion. The age-related differences in LV strain and torsion may reflect myocardial maturation and aging. ??2014 by the American Society of Echocardiography.},

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a respiratory biofeedback system could increase navigator efficiency and maintain image quality compared to conventional respiratory-gated magnetic resonance coronary angiography (MRCA). Materials and Methods. Eighteen healthy volunteers underwent MRCA using three different respiratory-gating protocols. A conventional expiratory free-breathing (FB) sequence was compared to two approaches using navigator echo biofeedback (NEB), a midinspiratory approach (NEBin) and an expiratory approach (NEBex). Navigator data reflecting the position of the diaphragm relative to a 3-mm gating window were made available to the subject using a video projector in combination with a Plexiglas screen and mirror goggles. Image quality was graded by two radiologists in consensus using a visual score ranging from I (not visible) to 4 (excellent vessel depiction). Results. The NEB approaches improved navigator efficiency (71.1{\%} with NEBex and 68.0{\%} with NEBin vs 42.2{\%} with FB), thus reducing total imaging time. This difference was statistically significant (P(NEBin).007; P(NEBex), =.001). Image quality in the NEBex group was comparable to that in the FB group (median score, 2.44 vs 2.52), but it proved to be significantly lower (median score, 1.94 vs 2.52) for the right coronary artery and the left anterior descending coronary artery in the NEBin group. Conclusion. NEB maintains image quality and significantly increases navigator efficiency, thereby decreasing total imaging time by about 40{\%} compared to a conventional FB acquisition strategy.},

abstract = {A novel magnetic resonance imaging technique provides direct imaging of motion by spatially modulating the degree of magnetization prior to imaging. The preimaging pulse sequence consists of a radio-frequency (RF) pulse to produce transverse magnetization, a magnetic field gradient to "wrap" the phase along the direction of the gradient, and a second RF pulse to mix the modulated transverse magnetization with the longitudinal magnetization. The resulting images show periodic stripes due to the modulation. Motion between the time of striping and image formation is directly demonstrated as a corresponding displacement of the stripes. This technique can be used to study heart wall motion, to distinguish slowly moving blood from thrombus, and to study the flow of blood and cerebrospinal fluid.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Fast cine displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) MR has higher spatial resolution and enables rapid postprocessing. Thus we compared the accuracy of regional strains computation by DENSE with tagged MR in healthy and non-ischemic, non-valvular dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) subjects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Validation of three-dimensional regional strains computed with DENSE was conducted in reference to standard tagged MRI (TMRI) in healthy subjects and patients with DCM. Additional repeatability studies in healthy subjects were conducted to increase confidence in DENSE. A meshfree multiquadrics radial point interpolation method (RPIM) was used for computing Lagrange strains in sixteen left ventricular segments. Bland-Altman analysis and Student's t-tests were conducted to observe similarities in regional strains between sequences and in DENSE repeatability studies.

RESULTS: Regional circumferential strains ranged from -0.21 ± 0.07 (Lateral-Apex) to -0.11 ± 0.05 (Posterorseptal-Base) in healthy subjects and -0.15 ± 0.04 (Anterior-Apex) to -0.02 ± 0.08 (Posterorseptal-Base) in DCM patients. Computed mean differences in regional circumferential strain from the DENSE-TMRI comparison study was 0.01 ± 0.03 (95{\%} limits of agreement) in normal subjects, -0.01 ± 0.06 in DCM patients and 0.0 ± 0.02 in repeatability studies, with similar agreements in longitudinal and radial strains.

CONCLUSION: We found agreement between DENSE and tagged MR in patients and volunteers in terms of evaluation of regional strains.J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In addition, previously described 2D postprocessing algorithms including phase unwrapping, tissue tracking, and strain tensor calculation for the left ventricle (LV) were extended to 3D. These 3D methods were evaluated in five healthy volunteers, using 2D cine DENSE and historical 3D myocardial tagging as reference standards. With an average scan time of 20.5 +/- 5.7 min, 3D data sets with a matrix size of 128 x 128 x 22, voxel size of 2.8 x 2.8 x 5.0 mm(3), and temporal resolution of 32 msec were obtained with displacement encoding in three orthogonal directions. Mean values for end-systolic mid-ventricular mid-wall radial, circumferential, and longitudinal strain were 0.33 +/- 0.10, -0.17 +/- 0.02, and -0.16 +/- 0.02, respectively. Transmural strain gradients were detected in the radial and circumferential directions, reflecting high spatial resolution. Good agreement by linear correlation and Bland-Altman analysis was achieved when comparing normal strains measured by 2D and 3D cine DENSE. Also, the 3D strains, twist, and torsion results obtained by 3D cine DENSE were in good agreement with historical values measured by 3D myocardial tagging.},

abstract = {Displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) encodes myocardial tissue displacement into the phase of the MR image. Cine DENSE allows for rapid quantification of myocardial displacement at multiple cardiac phases through the majority of the cardiac cycle. For practical sensitivities to motion, relatively high displacement encoding frequencies are used and phase wrapping typically occurs. In order to obtain absolute measures of displacement, a two-dimensional (2-D) quality-guided phase unwrapping algorithm was adapted to unwrap both spatially and temporally. Both a fully automated algorithm and a faster semi-automated algorithm are proposed. A method for computing the 2-D trajectories of discrete points in the myocardium as they move through the cardiac cycle is introduced. The error in individual displacement measurements is reduced by fitting a time series to sequential displacement measurements along each trajectory. This improvement is in turn reflected in strain maps, which are derived directly from the trajectories. These methods were validated both in vivo and on a rotating phantom. Further measurements were made to optimize the displacement encoding frequency and to estimate the baseline strain noise both on the phantom and in vivo. The fully automated phase unwrapping algorithm was successful for 767 out of 800 images (95.9{\%}), and the semi-automated algorithm was successful for 786 out of 800 images (98.3{\%}). The accuracy of the tracking algorithm for typical cardiac displacements on a rotating phantom is 0.24 +/- 0.15 mm. The optimal displacement encoding frequency is in the region of 0.1 cycles/mm, and, for 2 scans of 17-s duration, the strain noise after temporal fitting was estimated to be 2.5 +/- 3.0{\%} at end-diastole, 3.1 +/- 3.1{\%} at end-systole, and 5.3 +/- 5.0{\%} in mid-diastole. The improvement in intra-myocardial strain measurements due to temporal fitting is apparent in strain histograms, and also in identifying regions of dysfunctional myocardium in studies of patients with infarcts.},

The authors have conducted validation experiments including volunteers and a moving high-precision platform to verify the method's suitability for providing meaningful data. In addition, the authors employed it during clinical 18F-FDG-PET scans and exemplarily analyzed the acquired data of ten cancer patients. External signals of abdominal and thoracic regions as well as data-driven signals were used for gating and compared with respect to detected displacement of present lesions. Additionally, the authors quantified signal similarities and time shifts by analyzing cross-correlation sequences.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResults:$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe authors' results suggest a Kinect depth resolution of approximately 1 mm at 75 cm distance. Accordingly, valid signals could be obtained for surface movements with small amplitudes in the range of only few millimeters. In this small sample of ten patients, the abdominal signals were better suited for gating the PET data than the thoracic signals and the correlation of data-driven signals was found to be stronger with abdominal signals than with thoracic signals (average Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.74 ± 0.17 and 0.45 ± 0.23, respectively). In all cases, except one, the abdominal respiratory motion preceded the thoracic motion—a maximum delay of approximately 600 ms was detected.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nConclusions:$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe method provides motion information with sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution. Thus, it enables meaningful analysis in the form of comparisons between amplitudes and phase shifts of signals from different regions. In combination with a large field-of-view, as given by combining the data of two Kinect cameras, it yields surface representations that might be useful in the context of motion correction and motion modeling.},

abstract = {In displacement-encoded imaging with stimulated echoes (DENSE), tissue displacement is encoded in the phase of the stimulated echo. However, three echoes generally contribute to the acquired signal (the stimulated echo, the complex conjugate of the stimulated echo, and an echo due to T(1) relaxation). It is usually desirable to suppress all except the stimulated echo, since otherwise the additional echoes will cause displacement measurement errors. Ideally, suppression of the artifact-generating echoes would be independent of time, T(1), and displacement-encoding frequency, and would not require additional acquisitions. In this study through-plane gradients were used to selectively dephase artifact-generating echoes without causing significant signal loss of the stimulated echo. A cine DENSE sequence was modified to include dephasing gradients and perform complementary spatial modulation of magnetization (CSPAMM). For single-acquisition cine DENSE using dephasing alone, artifact suppression was similar to CSPAMM with two acquisitions. The use of dephasing with CSPAMM required two acquisitions, but demonstrated greater artifact suppression than CSPAMM alone or dephasing alone.},

However, data using CMR-FT to quantify left ventricular (LV) torsion and diastolic recoil are not yet available. We therefore sought to evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of CMR-FT to quantify LV torsion and peak recoil rate using an optimal anatomical approach.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Short-axis cine stacks were acquired at rest and during dobutamine stimulation (10 and 20 µg {\textperiodcentered} kg(-1) {\textperiodcentered} min(-1)) in 10 healthy volunteers. Rotational displacement was analysed for all slices. A complete 3D-LV rotational model was developed using linear interpolation between adjacent slices. Torsion was defined as the difference between apical and basal rotation, divided by slice distance. Depending on the distance between the most apical (defined as 0{\%} LV distance) and basal (defined as 100{\%} LV distance) slices, four different models for the calculation of torsion were examined: Model-1 (25-75{\%}), Model-2 (0-100{\%}), Model-3 (25-100{\%}) and Model-4 (0-75{\%}). Analysis included subendocardial, subepicardial and global torsion and recoil rate (mean of subendocardial and subepicardial values).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Quantification of torsion and recoil rate was feasible in all subjects. There was no significant difference between the different models at rest. However, only Model-1 (25-75{\%}) discriminated between rest and stress (Global Torsion: 2.7 ± 1.5° cm(-1), 3.6 ± 2.0° cm(-1), 5.1 ± 2.2° cm(-1), p{\textless}0.01; Global Recoil Rate: -30.1 ± 11.1° cm(-1) s(-1),-46.9 ± 15.0° cm(-1) s(-1),-68.9 ± 32.3° cm(-1) s(-1), p{\textless}0.01; for rest, 10 and 20 µg {\textperiodcentered} kg(-)1 {\textperiodcentered} min(-1) of dobutamine, respectively).

Using an optimal anatomical approach measuring rotation at 25{\%} and 75{\%} apical and basal LV locations allows effective quantification of torsion and recoil dynamics. Application of these new measures of deformation by CMR-FT should next be explored in disease states.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging exams can be performed during free-breathing. This may be especially important for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) given their frequently limited breath-hold abilities. The impact of the respiratory compensation method on quantitative measurements of left ventricular (LV) rotational mechanics is incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in LV rotational mechanics acquired during breath-holding (BH), free-breathing with averaging (AVG), and free-breathing with respiratory bellows gating (BEL). METHODS LV short-axis tagged images from healthy subjects (N = 16) and DMD patients (N = 5) were acquired with BH, AVG, and BEL. LV twist and circumferential-longitudinal shear (CL-shear) angle were measured using the Fourier Analysis of STimulated echoes (FAST) method. RESULTS Peak LV twist estimates using BEL were significantly lower compared with BH in both healthy subjects (10.2 ± 3.6 ° versus 12.9 ± 2.3 °, P = 0.003) and patients with DMD (8.6 ± 3.6 ° versus 10.5 ± 3.6 °, P = 0.004). AVG results were in between BEL and BH. No significant differences in CL-shear were detected between BEL and BH. CONCLUSION Breath-holding directly affects estimates of peak LV twist, but not CL-shear. Using a free-breathing strategy for the evaluation of cardiac function is important for intrasubject longitudinal studies, intersubject comparisons, and multicenter trials for patients with DMD.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phase contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is able to measure all three directional components of the velocities of blood flow relative to the three spatial dimensions and the time course of the heart cycle. In this article, methods used for the acquisition, visualization, and quantification of such datasets are reviewed and illustrated. METHODS: Currently, the acquisition of 3D cine (4D) phase contrast velocity data, synchronized relative to both cardiac and respiratory movements takes about ten minutes or more, even when using parallel imaging and optimized pulse sequence design. The large resulting datasets need appropriate post processing for the visualization of multidirectional flow, for example as vector fields, pathlines or streamlines, or for retrospective volumetric quantification. APPLICATIONS: Multidirectional velocity acquisitions have provided 3D visualization of large scale flow features of the healthy heart and great vessels, and have shown altered patterns of flow in abnormal chambers and vessels. Clinically relevant examples include retrograde streams in atheromatous descending aortas as potential thrombo-embolic pathways in patients with cryptogenic stroke and marked variations of flow visualized in common aortic pathologies. Compared to standard clinical tools, 4D velocity mapping offers the potential for retrospective quantification of flow and other hemodynamic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Multidirectional, 3D cine velocity acquisitions are contributing to the understanding of normal and pathologically altered blood flow features. Although more rapid and user-friendly strategies for acquisition and analysis may be needed before 4D velocity acquisitions come to be adopted in routine clinical CMR, their capacity to measure multidirectional flows throughout a study volume has contributed novel insights into cardiovascular fluid dynamics in health and disease.},

@article{Stuber1999,
abstract = {Myocardial tagging has shown to be a useful magnetic resonance modality for the assessment and quantification of local myocardial function. Many myocardial tagging techniques suffer from a rapid fading of the tags, restricting their application mainly to systolic phases of the cardiac cycle. However, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction has been increasingly appreciated as a major cause of heart failure. Subtraction based slice-following CSPAMM myocardial tagging has shown to overcome limitations such as fading of the tags. Remaining impediments to this technique, however, are extensive scanning times (approximately 10 min), the requirement of repeated breath-holds using a coached breathing pattern, and the enhanced sensitivity to artifacts related to poor patient compliance or inconsistent depths of end-expiratory breath-holds. We therefore propose a combination of slice-following CSPAMM myocardial tagging with a segmented EPI imaging sequence. Together with an optimized RF excitation scheme, this enables to acquire as many as 20 systolic and diastolic grid-tagged images per cardiac cycle with a high tagging contrast during a short period of sustained respiration.},

SSFP images were analyzed offline using MR-FT to assess rotational displacement in apical and basal slices. Global peak torsion, peak systolic and peak diastolic torsion rates were calculated using different definitions ("twist", "normalized twist" and "circumferential-longitudinal (CL) shear angle"). Exam A and B were compared to assess the inter-study reproducibility. Morning and afternoon scans were compared to address possible diurnal variation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The different methods showed good inter-study reproducibility for global peak torsion (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.90-0.92; coefficient of variation [CoV]: 19.0-20.3{\%}) and global peak systolic torsion rate (ICC: 0.82-0.84; CoV: 25.9-29.0{\%}). Conversely, global peak diastolic torsion rate showed little inter-study reproducibility (ICC: 0.34-0.47; CoV: 40.8-45.5{\%}). Global peak torsion as determined by the CL shear angle showed the best inter-study reproducibility (ICC: 0.90;CoV: 19.0{\%}). MR-FT results were not measurably affected by diurnal variation between morning and afternoon scans (CL shear angle: 4.8 ± 1.4°, 4.8 ± 1.5°, and 4.1 ± 1.6° for Exam A, B, and C, respectively; P = 0.21).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: MR-FT based derivation of myocardial peak torsion and peak systolic torsion rate has high inter-study reproducibility as opposed to peak diastolic torsion rate. The CL shear angle was the most reproducible parameter independently of cardiac anatomy and may develop into a robust tool to quantify cardiac rotational mechanics in longitudinal MR-FT patient studies.

abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The accuracy of myocardial motion measurements, computed from cine-phase contrast (cine-PC) magnetic resonance (MR) velocity data, was compared with directly visualized motion of MR signal voids caused by implanted tantalum markers in anesthetized dogs. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were electrocardiogram-gated and divided into 16 phases per cardiac cycle. Myocardial trajectories as a function of time in the cardiac cycle were measured using both methods for four to seven markers in each of eight animals. RESULTS: The peak observed in-plane excursion was 4.0 +/- 2.1 mm. The average deviation between displacements derived from velocity data versus displacements visualized directly was 1.1 +/- 0.7 mm (27.5{\%} of the peak displacement). The difference was less if three separate MR scans were used to measure each velocity component in the cine-PC method. This improvement is probably caused by improved temporal resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Cine-PC MRI offers a noninvasive method for accurate quantification of myocardial motion.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To establish the reproducibility of complementary spatial modulation of magnetization (CSPAMM) tagged cardiovascular MR (CMR) data in normal volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers underwent CMR studies on two separate occasions using an identical CSPAMM pulse sequence with images acquired in three short axis slices. Data were analyzed by two independent observers using harmonic phase analysis (HARP). Lagrangian circumferential and radial strain, rotation, and left ventricular twist were calculated. RESULTS: The intraobserver reproducibility of circumferential strain (CoV [coefficient of variation] 1.5-4.3{\%}) and LV twist (CoV 1.2-4.4{\%}) was better than radial strain (CoV 10.6-14.8{\%}). For interobserver reproducibility, circumferential strain (CoV 3.5-6.2{\%}) and LV twist (CoV 3.5-7.2{\%}) were more reproducible than radial strain (CoV 11.8-21.8{\%}). Interstudy reproducibility of circumferential strain (CoV 3.7-5.5{\%}) and LV twist (CoV 9.8-12.2{\%}) were good but radial strain (CoV 13.8-23.4{\%}) but showed poorer interstudy reproducibility. Sample size calculations suggested 20 or fewer subjects are needed to detect a 10{\%} change in circumferential strain (power 90{\%}; $\alpha$ error 0.05), whereas for twist, 66 subjects would be required. CONCLUSION: In normal volunteers, the intraobserver, interobserver, and interstudy reproducibility of circumferential strain and LV twist measured from CSPAMM tagged CMR data are good, but are less so for radial strain.},

abstract = {Objective: Rotation of the left ventricular apex relative to the base, or left ventricular torsion, is related to myocardial contractility and structure and is a sensitive indicator of cardiac dysfunction. We have quantified left ventricular systolic rotation and torsion in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy before and after partial left ventriculectomy in an attempt to characterize the effects of this surgical procedure on ventricular ejection mechanics. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging with tissue tagging was performed before partial left ventriculectomy in 24 patients, 9 of whom underwent repeat imaging 3 months after surgery. Left ventricular rotation was quantified in each patient at three short-axis levels: apex, midventricle, and base. Torsion was defined as the difference between basal and apical rotation at any time. Results were subdivided for regional analysis at each level and related to cardiac function (ejection fraction, cardiac index, and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening). Results: Before surgery, left ventricular rotation was regionally heterogeneous and abnormal in magnitude and pattern, and increased end-systolic torsion was associated with better cardiac function. After surgery, clinical indices of cardiac function showed improvement; however, rotation magnitude was unchanged at the apex and reduced at the base and midventricle, particularly in the anterior wall and septum. Conclusions: The pattern and magnitude of ventricular rotation were impaired by dilated cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular rotation and torsion were further diminished after partial left ventriculectomy, indicating that improvement in clinical indices of cardiac function was not reflective of an improvement in this measure of myocardial mechanics.},

abstract = {Displacement encoding using stimulated echoes (DENSE) and spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM) are MRI techniques for quantifying myocardial displacement and strain. However, DENSE has not been compared against SPAMM in phantoms exhibiting nonhomogeneous strain, and interobserver variability has not been compared between DENSE and SPAMM. To perform these comparisons, there is a need for a generalized analysis framework for the evaluation of myocardial strain. A spatiotemporal mathematical model was used to represent myocardial geometry and motion. The model was warped to each frame using tissue displacement maps calculated from either automated phase unwrapping (DENSE) or nonrigid registration (SPAMM). Strain and motion were then calculated from the model using standard methods. DENSE and SPAMM results were compared in a deformable gel phantom exhibiting known nonhomogeneous strain, and interobserver errors were determined in 19 healthy human volunteers. Nonhomogeneous strain in the phantom was accurately quantified using both DENSE and SPAMM. In the healthy volunteers, DENSE produced better interobserver errors than SPAMM for radial strain (-0.009 ± 0.069 vs. 0.029 ± 0.152, respectively, bias ± 95{\%} confidence interval). In conclusion, generalized spatiotemporal modeling enables robust myocardial strain analysis for DENSE or SPAMM.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare nongated three-dimensional (3D) contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) with 3D-navigated cardiac-gated steady-state free-precession bright blood (3D-nav SSFP) and noncontrast 2D techniques for ascending aorta dimension measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five clinical exams were reviewed to evaluate the ascending aorta at 1.5T using: breathhold cine bright blood (SSFP), cardiac-triggered T2 black blood (T2 BB), axial 3D-nav SSFP, and nongated 3D CE-MRA. Three radiologists independently measured aortic size at three specified locations for each sequence. Means, SDs, interobserver correlation, and vessel edge sharpness were statistically evaluated. RESULTS: Measurements were greatest for 3D-nav SSFP and 3D CE-MRA and smallest for T2 BB. There was no significant difference between 3D-nav SSFP and 3D CE-MRA (P = 0.43-0.86), but significance was observed comparing T2 BB to all sequences. Interobserver agreement was uniformly {\textgreater}0.9, with T2 BB best, followed closely by 3D-nav SSFP and 2D cine SSFP, and 3D CE-MRA being the worst. Edge sharpness was significantly poorer for 3D CE-MRA compared to the other sequences (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: If diameter measurements are the main clinical concern, 3D-nav SSFP appears to be the best choice, as it has a sharp edge profile, is easy to acquire and postprocess, and shows very good interobserver correlation.},

abstract = {A breath-hold two-dimensional cine magnetic resonance (MR) pulse sequence based on displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) for quantitative myocardial motion tracking was developed and evaluated. In the sequence, complementary spatial modulation of magnetization was used for time-independent artifact suppression, and echo-planar imaging was used for rapid data sampling. Twelve healthy volunteers underwent cine DENSE MR imaging, and six of them also underwent conventional MR imaging myocardial tagging. The circumferential shortening component of strain (E(cc)) was measured on cine DENSE MR images and conventional tagged MR images. With complementary spatial modulation of magnetization, 10{\%} or less of the total cine DENSE MR image energy was attributed to an artifact-generating echo during systolic imaging. Two-dimensional intramyocardial displacement and strain were measured at cine DENSE MR imaging with spatial resolution and temporal resolution of 2.7 x 2.7 mm and 60 msec, respectively. E(cc) measured at cine DENSE MR imaging correlated well with that measured at conventional MR imaging tagging (slope = 0.88, intercept = 0.00, R = 0.87).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mechanics of the right ventricle (RV) are not well understood as studies of the RV have been limited. This is, in part, due to the RV's thin wall, asymmetric geometry and irregular motion. However, the RV plays an important role in cardiovascular function. This study aims to describe the complex mechanics of the healthy RV using three dimensional (3D) cine displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). METHODS: Whole heart 3D cine DENSE data were acquired from five healthy volunteers. Tailored post-processing algorithms for RV mid-wall tissue tracking and strain estimation are presented. A method for sub-dividing the RV into four regions according to anatomical land marks is proposed, and the temporal evolution of strain was assessed in these regions. RESULTS: The 3D cine DENSE tissue tracking methods successfully capture the motion and deformation of the RV at a high spatial resolution in all volunteers. The regional Lagrangian peak surface strain and time to peak values correspond with previous studies using myocardial tagging, DENSE and strain encoded CMR. The inflow region consistently displays lower peak strains than the apical and outflow regions, and the time to peak strains suggest RV mechanical activation in the following order: inflow, outflow, mid, then apex. CONCLUSIONS: Model-free techniques have been developed to study the myocardial mechanics of the RV at a high spatial resolution using 3D cine DENSE CMR. The consistency of the regional RV strain patterns across healthy subjects is encouraging and the techniques may have clinical utility in assessing disrupted RV mechanics in the diseased heart.},

abstract = {Quantitative assessment of regional cardiac function can improve the accuracy of detecting wall motion abnormalities due to heart disease. While recently developed fast cine displacement-encoded with stimulated echoes (DENSE) MRI is a promising modality for the quantification of regional myocardial function, it has not been validated for clinical applications. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to validate the accuracy of fast cine DENSE MRI with numerical simulation and in vivo experiments. A numerical phantom was generated to model physiologically relevant deformation of the heart, and the accuracy of fast cine DENSE was evaluated against the numerical reference. For in vivo validation, 12 controls and 13 heart-disease patients were imaged using both fast cine DENSE and myocardial tagged MRI. Numerical simulation demonstrated that the echo-combination DENSE reconstruction method is relatively insensitive to clinically relevant resonance frequency offsets. The strain measurements by fast cine DENSE and the numerical reference were strongly correlated and in excellent agreement (mean difference = 0.00; 95{\%} limits of agreement were 0.01 and -0.02). The strain measurements by fast cine DENSE and myocardial tagged MRI were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient = 0.92) and in good agreement (mean difference = 0.01; 95{\%} limits of agreement were 0.07 and -0.04).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Displacement encoded Cardiovascular MR (CMR) can provide high spatial resolution measurements of three-dimensional (3D) Lagrangian displacement. Spatial gradients of the Lagrangian displacement field are used to measure regional myocardial strain. In general, adjacent parallel slices are needed in order to calculate the spatial gradient in the through-slice direction. This necessitates the acquisition of additional data and prolongs the scan time. The goal of this study is to define an analytic solution that supports the reconstruction of the out-of-plane components of the Lagrangian strain tensor in addition to the in-plane components from a single-slice displacement CMR dataset with high spatio-temporal resolution. The technique assumes incompressibility of the myocardium as a physical constraint. RESULTS: The feasibility of the method is demonstrated in a healthy human subject and the results are compared to those of other studies. The proposed method was validated with simulated data and strain estimates from experimentally measured DENSE data, which were compared to the strain calculation from a conventional two-slice acquisition. CONCLUSION: This analytical method reduces the need to acquire data from adjacent slices when calculating regional Lagrangian strains and can effectively reduce the long scan time by a factor of two.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance using displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) is capable of assessing advanced measures of cardiac mechanics such as strain and torsion. A potential hurdle to widespread clinical adoption of DENSE is the time required to manually segment the myocardium during post-processing of the images. To overcome this hurdle, we proposed a radical approach in which only three contours per image slice are required for post-processing (instead of the typical 30-40 contours per image slice). We hypothesized that peak left ventricular circumferential, longitudinal and radial strains and torsion could be accurately quantified using this simplified analysis.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We tested our hypothesis on a large multi-institutional dataset consisting of 541 DENSE image slices from 135 mice and 234 DENSE image slices from 62 humans. We compared measures of cardiac mechanics derived from the simplified post-processing to those derived from original post-processing utilizing the full set of 30-40 manually-defined contours per image slice. Accuracy was assessed with Bland-Altman limits of agreement and summarized with a modified coefficient of variation. The simplified technique showed high accuracy with all coefficients of variation less than 10{\%} in humans and 6{\%} in mice. The accuracy of the simplified technique was also superior to two previously published semi-automated analysis techniques for DENSE post-processing.

CONCLUSIONS: Accurate measures of cardiac mechanics can be derived from DENSE cardiac magnetic resonance in both humans and mice using a simplified technique to reduce post-processing time by approximately 94{\%}. These findings demonstrate that quantifying cardiac mechanics from DENSE data is simple enough to be integrated into the clinical workflow.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To present a database of systolic three-dimensional (3D) strain evolution throughout the normal left ventricle (LV) in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 31 healthy volunteers, magnetic resonance (MR) tissue tagging and breath-hold MR imaging were used to generate and then detect the motion of transient fiducial markers (ie, tags) in the heart every 32 msec. Strain and motion were calculated from a 3D displacement field that was fit to the tag data. Special indexes of contraction and thickening that were based on multiple strain components also were evaluated. RESULTS: The temporal evolution of local strains was linear during the first half of systole. The peak shortening and thickening strain components were typically greatest in the anterolateral wall, increased toward the apex, and increased toward the endocardium. Shears and displacements were more spatially variable. The two specialized indexes of contraction and thickening had higher measurement precision and tighter normal ranges than did the traditional strain components. CONCLUSION: In this study, the authors noninvasively characterized the normal systolic ranges of 3D displacement and strain evolution throughout the human LV. Comparison against this multidimensional database may permit sensitive detection of systolic LV dysfunction.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate and quantify motion of the diaphragm and heart during suspended breathing at end inspiration and end expiration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 10 healthy adult volunteers, line scanning was performed to monitor the position of the diaphragm during a breath hold at end inspiration and end expiration, with a spatial and temporal resolution of 0.25 mm and 200 msec, respectively. Electrocardiographically gated, turbo fast low-angle shot (FLASH) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed to monitor movement of the diaphragm and heart. RESULTS: During a breath hold, the diaphragm moved upward. At end expiration, the velocity of the diaphragm during suspended breathing was constant (mean, 0.15 mm/sec). At end inspiration, motion of the diaphragm during suspended breathing was more complex (range, 0.1-7.9 mm/sec). During a 20-second breath hold, mean displacement of the diaphragm was 25{\%} of that during normal breathing. FLASH MR imaging revealed variations in the position of the heart during a breath hold. During suspended respiration, the heart did not return to the same position on consecutive heartbeats and, consequently, the margins of the heart typically moved inward. CONCLUSION: Breath holding does not eliminate motion of the diaphragm. Changes in the motion of the diaphragm and transthoracic pressure during a breath hold result in complex movement of the heart and may cause blurring during breath-hold MR imaging.},

A major cause of the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity and diabetes is heart disease, yet the mechanisms that lead to cardiovascular complications remain unclear. METHODS: We performed cardiac MRI to assess left ventricular morphology and function during the development of moderate obesity and insulin resistance in a well-established canine model (n = 26). To assess the influence of dietary fat composition, we randomised animals to a traditional lard diet (rich in saturated and monounsaturated fat; n = 12), a salmon oil diet (rich in polyunsaturated fat; n = 8) or a control diet (n = 6). RESULTS: High-fat feeding with lard increased body weight and fasting insulin and markedly reduced insulin sensitivity. Lard feeding also significantly reduced left ventricular function, evidenced by a worsening of circumferential strain and impairment in left ventricular torsion. High-fat feeding with salmon oil increased body weight; however, salmon oil feeding did not impair insulin sensitivity or cardiac function. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data emphasise the importance of dietary fat composition on both metabolic and cardiac function, and have important implications for the relationship between diet and health.},

abstract = {AIMS: We used speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) to make a comparison between the effects of ageing and of heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HfnEF) on left ventricular (LV) torsion and strain patterns. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty patients with HfnEF, 27 young controls and 26 older controls, were prospectively recruited. All subjects underwent clinical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, pulmonary function test, echocardiogram, and metabolic exercise test. LV torsion increases with advancing age (older controls vs. young controls, 2.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.8 degrees /cm; P = 0.03). Circumferential strain was enhanced in patients with HfnEF (-24.7 +/- 4.7 vs. -20.0 +/- 4.9{\%}; P = 0.003). Rotational deformation delay (time difference between peak basal rotation and peak apical rotation), global circumferential strain, E-velocity deceleration time, and LV end-diastolic volume index were independent predictors of LV torsion. LV torsion and body mass index were independent predictors of LV untwist rate. CONCLUSION: Ageing is associated with increased LV torsion secondary to reduced rotational deformation delay and increased peak basal rotation. LV torsion and strain patterns in patients with HfnEF are similar to age-related changes apart from circumferential strain, which is enhanced in patients with HfnEF.},

abstract = {Temporal changes in respiration could influence navigator-echo (NE)-gated MR coronary angiography (MRCA), but systematic investigation of the effects of such variations and how to limit them has not been performed. We addressed these issues by studying the influence of time in the magnet on diaphragm position and respiratory patterns using NE diaphragm monitoring in volunteers and a phantom model. NE diaphragm monitoring was performed at .5 T in 10 subjects over a total period of 35 minutes. The end-expiratory position was sustained for longer (1.1 vs .4 seconds, P {\textless} .001) and with greater position stability (SD 1.9 vs 5.9 mm, P = .01) than the end-inspiratory position. Drift of the end-expiratory position occurred over time, causing a fall in scan efficiency (44-28{\%}, P = .01). Up-drift of the end-expiratory position was most common. Loss of scan efficiency was worse with up-drift because of loss of the end-expiratory pause from the NE window (up-drift 10{\%} mm-1, down-drift 7{\%} mm-1, both P = .03). Scan efficiency also was reduced during sleep (to a nadir of 0{\%}), secondary to loss of the end-expiratory pause, periodic breathing with oscillating end-expiratory position, and periods of apnea. The phantom model used actual diaphragm traces to evaluate the artifact resulting from diaphragm motion during acquisition. Artifact was considerably reduced by NE adaptive motion correction compared with NE gating alone (ghosting ratio 2.0 vs 2.8, P {\textless} .01). Artifact also was significantly reduced with up-drift if scan efficiency was maintained above 35{\%} (P = .05). For optimal NE-gated MRCA, the following features are important: the NE window should be placed around the end-expiratory position; subjects should not sleep; scan efficiency should be monitored and the NE window should be repositioned if scan efficiency falls below 35{\%}; and adaptive motion correction should be used.},

abstract = {Respiratory disease is the leading cause of death in the UK. Methods for assessing pulmonary function and chest wall movement are essential for accurate diagnosis, as well as monitoring response to treatment, operative procedures and rehabilitation. Despite this, there is a lack of low-cost devices for rapid assessment. Spirometry is used to measure air flow expired, but cannot infer or directly measure full chest wall motion. This paper presents the development of a low-cost chest wall motion assessment system. The prototype was developed using four Microsoft Kinect sensors to create a 3D time-varying representation of a patient's torso. An evaluation of the system in two phases is also presented. Initially, static volume of a resuscitation mannequin with that of a Nikon laser scanner is performed. This showed the system has slight underprediction of 0.441 {\%}. Next, a dynamic analysis through the comparison of results from the prototype and a spirometer in nine cystic fibrosis patients and thirteen healthy subjects was performed. This showed an agreement with correlation coefficients above 0.8656 in all participants. The system shows promise as a method for assessing respiratory disease in a cost-effective and timely manner. Further work must now be performed to develop the prototype and provide further evaluations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although global left ventricular systolic function is an important determinant of mortality, standard measures such as ejection fraction (EF) and wall motion score index (WMSI) have important technical limitations. The aim of this study was to compare global longitudinal speckle strain (GLS), an automated technique for measurement of long-axis function, with EF and WMSI for the prediction of mortality.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 546 consecutive individuals undergoing echocardiography for assessment of resting left ventricular function, 91 died over a period of 5.2+/-1.5 years. In addition to Simpson biplane EF, WMSI was determined by 2 experienced readers and GLS was calculated from 3 standard apical views using 2D speckle tracking. The incremental value of EF, WMSI, and GLS to significant clinical variables was assessed in nested Cox models. Clinical factors associated with outcome (model chi(2)=20.2) were age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; P{\textless}0.01), diabetes (HR, 1.88; P=0.01), and hypertension (HR, 1.59; P{\textless}0.05). Although addition of EF (HR, 1.23; P=0.03) or WMSI (HR, 1.28; P{\textless}0.01) added to the predictive power of clinical variables, the addition of GLS (HR, 1.45; P{\textless}0.001) caused the greatest increment in model power (chi(2)=34.9, P{\textless}0.001). GLS also provided incremental value in subgroups with EF {\textgreater}35{\%} and those with and without wall motion abnormalities. A GLS {\textgreater}or=-12{\%} was found to be equivalent to an EF {\textless}or=35{\%} for the prediction of prognosis. Intraobserver and interobserver variations for EF and GLS were similar.

CONCLUSIONS: GLS is a superior predictor of outcome to either EF or WMSI and may become the optimal method for assessment of global left ventricular systolic function.},

@article{Donekal2013a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to determine the test-retest reliability of the measurement of regional myocardial function by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) tagging using spatial modulation of magnetization. METHODS: Twenty-five participants underwent CMR tagging twice over 12 +/- 7 days. To assess the role of slice orientation on strain measurement, two healthy volunteers had a first exam, followed by image acquisition repeated with slices rotated +/-15 degrees out of true short axis, followed by a second exam in the true short axis plane. To assess the role of slice location, two healthy volunteers had whole heart tagging. The harmonic phase (HARP) method was used to analyze the tagged images. Peak midwall circumferential strain (Ecc), radial strain (Err), Lambda 1, Lambda 2, and Angle alpha were determined in basal, mid and apical slices. LV torsion, systolic and early diastolic circumferential strain and torsion rates were also determined. RESULTS: LV Ecc and torsion had excellent intra-, interobserver, and inter-study intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC range, 0.7 to 0.9). Err, Lambda 1, Lambda 2 and angle had excellent intra- and interobserver ICC than inter-study ICC. Angle had least inter-study reproducibility. Torsion rates had superior intra-, interobserver, and inter-study reproducibility to strain rates. The measurements of LV Ecc were comparable in all three slices with different short axis orientations (standard deviation of mean Ecc was 0.09, 0.18 and 0.16 at basal, mid and apical slices, respectively). The mean difference in LV Ecc between slices was more pronounced in most of the basal slices compared to the rest of the heart. CONCLUSIONS: Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of all strain and torsion parameters was excellent. Inter-study reproducibility of CMR tagging by SPAMM varied between different parameters as described in the results above and was superior for Ecc and LV torsion. The variation in LV Ecc measurement due to altered slice orientation is negligible compared to the variation due to slice location.Trial registration: This trial is registered as NCT00005487 at National Heart, Lung and Blood institute.},

Systolic LV twist was measured by color tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE) in 34 patients after anterior myocardial infarction and in 20 controls. In a subset of controls and patients, the assessment of LV twist by TDE was validated against magnetic resonance (MR) tissue tagging with good agreement between the two methods. Myocardial ischemia was responsible for a decrease in LV twist in infarct patients (P {\textless} 0.01). The decrease in LV twist was correlated with the extent of the asynergic area and global LV function as assessed by LV cineangiography (P {\textless} 0.001). Thus acute myocardial ischemia is responsible for a decrease in LV twist that is related to global LV function. Color TDE is a promising technique for straightforward assessment of LV twist in humans.},

abstract = {AIM: The influences on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of Displacement ENcoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) MRI of field strength, receiver coil sensitivity and choice of flip angle strategy have been previously investigated individually. In this study, all of these parameters have been investigated in the same setting, and a mutual comparison of their impact on SNR is presented.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were imaged in a 1.5 T and a 3 T MRI system, using standard five- or six-channel cardiac coils as well as 32-channel coils, with four different excitation patterns. Variation of spatial coil sensitivity was assessed by regional SNR analysis.

RESULTS: SNR ranging from 2.8 to 30.5 was found depending on the combination of excitation patterns, coil sensitivity and field strength. The SNR at 3 T was 53±26{\%} higher than at 1.5 T (P{\textless}.001), whereas spatial differences of 59±26{\%} were found in the ventricle (P{\textless}.001). Thirty-two-channel coils provided 52±29{\%} higher SNR compared to standard five- or six-channel coils (P{\textless}.001). A fixed flip angle strategy provided an excess of 50{\%} higher SNR in half of the imaged cardiac cycle compared to a sweeping flip angle strategy, and a single-phase acquisition provided a sixfold increase of SNR compared to a cine acquisition.

CONCLUSION: The effect of field strength and receiver coil sensitivity influences the SNR with the same order of magnitude, whereas flip angle strategy can have a larger effect on SNR. Thus, careful choice of imaging hardware in combination with adaptation of the acquisition protocol is crucial in order to realize sufficient SNR in DENSE MRI.},

For this purpose, the application of tissue Doppler echocardiography has rapidly increased. However, echocardiography has some major inherent limitations. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with tissue tagging provides highly reproducible data on myocardial function, not only in longitudinal and radial directions, but also in the circumferential direction. Because of the development of faster imaging protocols, improved temporal resolution, less time-consuming postprocessing procedures, and the potential of quantifying myocardial deformation in 3 dimensions at any point in the heart, this technique may serve as an alternative for tissue Doppler echocardiography and is now ready for more widespread clinical use. This review discusses the clinical use of cardiovascular magnetic resonance tissue tagging for quantitative assessment of regional myocardial function, thereby underlining the specific features and emerging role of this technique. {\textcopyright} 2006 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

The continuously adaptive windowing strategy, a fully automatic and highly efficient free-breathing navigator gated technique, is used to acquire the data as it ensures that all potential navigator acceptance windows are possible. This enables the rBF to be fully adaptable to a subject's respiratory pattern. Images of the thoracic aorta acquired using balanced steady-state free precession with continuously adaptive windowing strategy respiratory motion control, with and without rBF, were compared in 10 healthy subjects. Total scan time was reduced by using rBF. The mean scan time was reduced from 7 min 44 s (463 cardiac cycles, +/- 127 cc) without rBF to 5 min 43 s (380 cardiac cycles, +/- 118 cc) with the use of rBF (P {\textless} 0.05). Respiratory efficiency was increased from 45{\%} without rBF to 56{\%} with rBF (P {\textless} 0.01). Image quality was the same for both techniques (P = ns).

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and validate a free-breathing cardiac cine acquisition, with potential to simplify cardiac MR studies, provide registered slices, and increase spatial resolution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2D free-breathing (FB) navigator-gated cine radial acquisition for cardiac function was developed that used two navigators (one placed prior to the QRS, and another 500 msec after the QRS complex, after systole) to provide complete motion-compensated assessment of systole, without loss of end-diastole. Eleven subjects were studied. RESULTS: The 2D FB method provided results visually and quantitatively similar to the 2D breath-hold (BH) methods. Comparison of volumes measured with FB to those measured by standard 2D BH cine resulted in mean bias+/-2 standard deviations of 1.0 mL+/-13.7 mL, 1.1 mL+/-7.6 mL, 3.0 g+/-18.8 g, and 0.3{\%}+/-2.5{\%}, for end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, left ventricular (LV) mass, and ejection fraction, respectively. Slice misregistration was identified in four (36{\%}) of the BH studies, but none (0{\%}) of the FB studies. In subjects with slice misregistration, there was greater discordance in LV volume measurements (P{\textless}0.05 for end-diastolic mass). CONCLUSION: The FB cine acquisition provided results qualitatively and quantitatively similar to 2D BH methods with improved slice registration.},

The technique is based on locally perturbing the magnetization of the myocardium with selective radio-frequency (RF) saturation of multiple, thin tag planes during diastole followed by conventional, orthogonal-plane imaging during systole. The technique was implemented on a 0.38-T imager and tested on phantoms and volunteers. In humans, tags could be seen 60-450 msec after RF saturation, thus permitting sampling of the entire contractile phase of the cardiac cycle. Tagged regions appear as hypointense stripes, and their patterns of displacement reflect intervening cardiac motion. In addition to simple translation and rotation, complex motions such as cardiac twist can be demonstrated. The effects of RF pulse angle, relaxation times, and heart rate on depiction of the tagged region are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) is an important tool to assess cardiac function. However, one of the limitations of CMRI is the need for frequent breath-holding (BH) steps. This may be inconvenient to some patients and limit the use of this modality in patients unable to cooperate because of cognitive reasons or physically incapable of performing the required BH steps. The purpose of this study is to overcome the intrinsic timing and computation limitations of dual-navigator cine imaging and demonstrate the feasibility of free-breathing (FB) cine cardiac left ventricular function with a single-respiratory-navigator gating at 3 T. RESULTS: Eight participants underwent cine CMRI with both the conventional 2-dimensional cine BH and FB navigator-gated techniques. Scan parameters were identical, except in the FB technique, in which a respiratory navigator and only 2 signal averages were used. Images were scored for quality. Left ventricular end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume were calculated. The differences in the end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume assessed by the BH and FB were not statistically significant with P = 0.9 and 0.2, respectively. There was a good agreement between LV volumes with the limits of agreement (+/- 2 SD = +/- 22.36 mL). Image quality score was not significantly different (P = 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Free-breathing cine imaging utilizing a single-respiratory-navigator gating technique is comparable to conventional BH technique in both qualitative and quantitative imaging measures. Therefore, the FB cine technique can be used as an alternative for children and patients who are unable to hold their breath.},

abstract = {Fast breath-hold cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) shows excellent results for interstudy reproducibility of left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction, and mass, which are thought to be superior to results of 2-dimensional echocardiography. However, there is no direct comparison of the interstudy reproducibility of both methods in the same subjects. A total of 60 subjects (normal volunteers [n = 20], or patients with heart failure [n = 20] or LV hypertrophy [n = 20]) underwent 2 CMRs and 2 echocardiographic studies for assessment of LV volumes, function, and mass. The interstudy reproducibility coefficient of variability was superior for CMR in all groups for all parameters. Statistical significance was reached for end-systolic volume (4.4{\%} to 9.2{\%} vs 13.7{\%} to 20.3{\%}, p {\textless}0.001), ejection fraction (2.4{\%} to 7.3{\%} vs 8.6{\%} to 19.4{\%}, p {\textless}0.001), and mass (2.8{\%} to 4.8{\%} vs 11.6{\%} to 15.7{\%} p {\textless}0.001), with a trend for end-diastolic volume (2.9{\%} to 4.9{\%} vs 5.5{\%} to 10.5{\%}, p = 0.17). The superior interstudy reproducibility resulted in considerably lower calculated sample sizes (reductions of 55{\%} to 93{\%}) required by CMR compared with echocardiography to show clinically relevant changes in LV dimensions and function. Thus, CMR has excellent interstudy reproducibility in normal, dilated, and hypertrophic hearts, and is superior to 2-dimensional echocardiography.},

Magnetic resonance tissue tagging was used to measure strain in the left-ventricular heart wall in 10 healthy volunteers aged between 28 and 61 years. The three-dimensional motion was calculated from the displacement of marker points in short- and long-axis cine images, with a time resolution of 30 msec. Homogeneous strain analysis of small tetrahedrons was used to calculate deformation in 18 regions of the LV over a time span of 300 msec starting at end systole. End-systolic radial strain was largest near the heart base, and circumferential and longitudinal strains were largest near the apex. During diastole, the circumferential-longitudinal shear strain (associated with LV torsion) was found to recover earlier than the axial strains. Assessment of three-dimensional diastolic strain is possible with MR tagging. Comparison of patient strain against normal strain may permit early detection of regional diastolic dysfunction.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To determine the optimal respiratory navigator gating configuration for the quantification of left ventricular strain using spiral cine displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two-dimensional spiral cine DENSE was performed on a 3 Tesla MRI using two single-navigator configurations (retrospective, prospective) and a combined "dual-navigator" configuration in 10 healthy adults and 20 healthy children. The adults also underwent breathhold DENSE as a reference standard for comparisons. Peak left ventricular strains, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and navigator efficiency were compared. Subjects also underwent dual-navigator gating with and without visual feedback to determine the effect on navigator efficiency. RESULTS There were no differences in circumferential, radial, and longitudinal strains between navigator-gated and breathhold DENSE (P = 0.09-0.95) (as confidence intervals, retrospective: [-1.0{\%}-1.1{\%}], [-7.4{\%}-2.0{\%}], [-1.0{\%}-1.2{\%}]; prospective: [-0.6{\%}-2.7{\%}], [-2.8{\%}-8.3{\%}], [-0.3{\%}-2.9{\%}]; dual: [-1.6{\%}-0.5{\%}], [-8.3{\%}-3.2{\%}], [-0.8{\%}-1.9{\%}], respectively). The dual configuration maintained SNR compared with breathhold acquisitions (16 versus 18, P = 0.06). SNR for the prospective configuration was lower than for the dual navigator in adults (P = 0.004) and children (P {\textless} 0.001). Navigator efficiency was higher (P {\textless} 0.001) for both retrospective (54{\%}) and prospective (56{\%}) configurations compared with the dual configuration (35{\%}). Visual feedback improved the dual configuration navigator efficiency to 55{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION When quantifying left ventricular strains using spiral cine DENSE MRI, a dual navigator configuration results in the highest SNR in adults and children. In adults, a retrospective configuration has good navigator efficiency without a substantial drop in SNR. Prospective gating should be avoided because it has the lowest SNR. Visual feedback represents an effective option to maintain navigator efficiency while using a dual navigator configuration. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare cardiovascular magnetic resonance-feature tracking (CMR-FT) with spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM) tagged imaging for the calculation of short and long axis Lagrangian strain measures in systole and diastole. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy controls (n = 35) and patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 10) were identified prospectively and underwent steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine imaging and SPAMM imaging using a gradient-echo sequence. A timed offline analysis of images acquired at identical horizontal long and short axis slice positions was performed using CMR-FT and dynamic tissue-tagging (CIMTag2D). Agreement between strain and strain rate (SR) values calculated using these two different methods was assessed using the Bland-Altman technique. RESULTS: Across all participants, there was good agreement between CMR-FT and CIMTag for calculation of peak systolic global circumferential strain (-22.7 +/- 6.2{\%} vs. -22.5 +/- 6.9{\%}, bias 0.2 +/- 4.0{\%}) and SR (-1.35 +/- 0.42 1/s vs. -1.22 +/- 0.42 1/s, bias 0.13 +/- 0.33 1/s) and early diastolic global circumferential SR (1.21 +/- 0.44 1/s vs. 1.07 +/- 0.30 1/s, bias -0.14 +/- 0.34 1/s) at the subendocardium. There was satisfactory agreement for derivation of peak systolic global longitudinal strain (-18.1 +/- 5.0{\%} vs. -16.7 +/- 4.8{\%}, bias 1.3 +/- 3.8{\%}) and SR (-1.04 +/- 0.29 1/s vs. -0.95 +/- 0.32 1/s, bias 0.09 +/- 0.26 1/s). The weakest agreement was for early diastolic global longitudinal SR (1.10 +/- 0.40 1/s vs. 0.67 +/- 0.32 1/s, bias -0.42 +/- 0.40 1/s), although the correlation remained significant (r = 0.42, P {\textless} 0.01). CMR-FT generated these data over four times quicker than CIMTag. CONCLUSION: There is sufficient agreement between systolic and diastolic strain measures calculated using CMR-FT and myocardial tagging for CMR-FT to be considered as a potentially feasible and rapid alternative.},

abstract = {The effects of different pacing protocols on left ventricular (LV) torsion were evaluated over the full cardiac cycle. A systolic and diastolic series of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were combined and used to calculate the torsion of the LV in a canine model. The asynchronous activation resulting from ventricular pacing interferes with the temporal evolution of LV torsion. The torsion of the left ventricle was investigated under three different protocols: 1) right atrial pacing, 2) right ventricular pacing, and 3) simultaneous pacing from the right ventricular apex and LV base. The temporal evolution of torsion was determined from tagged MRI and evaluated over the cardiac cycle. The peak rotation for the atrially paced hearts was 11.1 degrees (+/- 3.5 degrees) compared to 6.1 degrees (+/- 1.7 degrees) and 6.1 degrees (+/- 0.7 degree) for those hearts paced from the right ventricle and from both ventricles, respectively. While biventricular pacing increases the synchrony of contraction, it significantly alters the pattern of LV torsion. From these experiments we have shown that measuring torsion is an extremely sensitive indicator of the existence of ectopic excitation.},

abstract = {Background: Left ventricular function is altered during and after AMI. Regional function can be determined by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) wall thickening, and velocity encoded (VE) strain analysis. The aims of this study were to investigate how regional myocardial wall function, assessed by CMR VE-strain and regional wall thickening, changes after acute myocardial infarction, and to determine if we could differentiate between ischemic, adjacent and remote segments of the left ventricle. Methods: Ten pigs underwent baseline CMR study for assessment of wall thickening and VE-strain. Ischemia was then induced for 40-minutes by intracoronary balloon inflation in the left anterior descending coronary artery. During occlusion, 99mTc tetrofosmin was administered intravenously and myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) was performed for determination of the ischemic area, followed by a second CMR study. Based on ischemia seen on MPS, the 17 AHA segments of the left ventricle was divided into 3 different categories (ischemic, adjacent and remote). Regional wall function measured by wall thickening and VE-strain analysis was determined before and after ischemia. Results: Mean wall thickening decreased significantly in the ischemic (from 2.7 mm to 0.65 mm, p {\textless} 0.001) and adjacent segments (from 2.4 to 1.5 mm p {\textless} 0.001). In remote segments, wall thickening increased significantly (from 2.4 mm to 2.8 mm, p {\textless} 0.01). In ischemic and adjacent segments, both radial and longitudinal strain was significantly decreased after ischemia (p {\textless} 0.001). In remote segments there was a significant increase in radial strain (p = 0.002) while there was no difference in longitudinal strain (p = 0.69). ROC analysis was performed to determine thresholds distinguishing between the different regions. Sensitivity for determining ischemic segments ranged from 70-80{\%}, and specificity from 72{\%}-77{\%}. There was a 9{\%} increase in left ventricular mass after ischemia.Conclusion: Differentiation thresholds for wall thickening and VE-strain could be established to distinguish between ischemic, adjacent and remote segments but will, have limited applicability due to low sensitivity and specificity. There is a slight increase in radial strain in remote segments after ischemia. Edema was present mainly in the ischemic region but also in the combined adjacent and remote segments.},
